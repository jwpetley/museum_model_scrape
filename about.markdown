<div class="text-center my-4 py-5 px-3 rounded-lg">
 <h2 class="font-weight-bold py-4">Accesible to all!</h2>
 <p class="lead font-weight-light py-2">Many of the greatest museums and galleries from all around the world are completely inaccessible to 99% of the globe, simply due to the cost of travel. We decided to utilise the growing number of institutions that have created 3D scans that can be found online to create our own museum experience.<p>
 
<p>This project was created during DurHack2023. We aimed to provide an accesible experience to all people who want to view a mix of museum artificats.</p>

<p class = "lead font-weight-light py-1">Below is an example of the kind of interactive models that exist in our musuem.</p>
